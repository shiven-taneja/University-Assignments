# University-Assignments
## Projects/Homework done in my most relvant university classes 

## CSC 384 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence 
### A3 - Game Tree Search
Solve the Othello game using: MiniMax and Alpha Beta Pruning. Speed it up using a Depth Limit and caching states. Created two heuristics for alpha beta pruning (Node ordering heuristic and my own heuristic) 
Grade: 93%

### A2 - Constraint Satisfaction
1. Propagators. Implemented two constraint propagators—a Forward Checking constraint prop- agator, and a Generalized Arc Consistence (GAC) constraint propagator
2. Models. Implemented three different CSP models: two grid-only puzzle models, and one full FunPuzz model (adding cage constraints to grid).
Grade: 100%

### A1 - Search
Implement a Solver for the provided Sokoban Game using different search alogorithms 
Grade: 82%



## CSC311 - Introduction to Machine Learning 
###  Final Project
Built machine learning algorithms to predict whether a student can correctly answer a specific diagnostic question based on the student’s previous answers to other questions and other students’ responses.

Used k-nearest-neighbors, Item-response-theory model, and a Neural Net
